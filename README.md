According to a survey conducted by StandOut CV in the UK, job applicants must apply to an average of 27 positions to receive even 1 interview, and 26% of people say they find the process to be "Extremely Stressful".

Our team developed EZApply to make this process easier on the job-seeker by reducing the time and key strokes necessary to apply for the exact same jobs.

EZApply is a Chrome Extension that autofills job applications. It was designed with this process specifically in mind, and can therefore account for filling in information that Chrome's autofill software does not. By visiting our online form, users can fill out their personal/employment/education information once and only once, and then use the extension to autofill any of their online job applications.

EZApply was designed to bridge the gap between the large job search services. Many online job applications (e.g. many Fortune 500 companies) disallow autofill services like Chrome's autofill. EZApply was written to bypass typical bans on Chrome autofill functionality by injecting JavaScript that dynamically reads and changes the values of the specific inputs on each page. EZApply will work on any form, letting the user quickly and easily fill out applications with their application information. 

**Get involved/Contribute**: Our team is new to software development. We have taken this idea to fruition and pushed our boundaries with the capabilities of the application. However, our skills are still very limited. We would like to make EZApply open-source and call on the collaboration of developers in the field to make it really shine. 
We began this project with one idea in mind: Applying for jobs **sucks**. We would like to fix that. But we need your help to make it as useful as possible.
